# EECS731 - Project 6: Anomaly Detection
*Grant Gollier*

## Overview
The goal of this project was to use a dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab) and perform Anomaly Detection. I ended up using the Amazon Twitter dataset which counts mentions of Amazon on twitter. I had varying performance on the algorithms and need to do a bit more work on some of the models especially with respect to how time is handled. To see more information check out the [Anomaly Detection Notebook](./notebooks/1-Anomaly_Detection.ipynb).
